## Problem Statement

A lot of people—especially those in rural or less connected areas—struggle with financial know-how. Things like using UPI, spotting online scams, understanding interest rates, or managing a monthly budget can feel confusing or overwhelming. Without the right support, this can lead to falling for fraud, making poor financial decisions, or being left out of the digital world altogether.
